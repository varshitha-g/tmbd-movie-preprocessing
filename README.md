## Overview

The TMDB Movie Preprocessing project is designed to clean and preprocess movie data from the TMDB dataset. The dataset contains a variety of features, such as movie titles, genres, release dates, and ratings. This project prepares the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and generating new features, making it ready for further analysis or model building.

## Dataset

Source: TMDB (The Movie Database)

Features: Includes columns like movie titles, genres, release dates, budget, revenue, and ratings.

Preprocessing: The raw data undergoes transformations such as null value handling, feature encoding, and data normalization.
## Data Preprocessing Steps

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features like profit, release year, and genre encoding.

Normalization and Encoding: Scaling numeric features and encoding categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.
## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for data processing.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

Scikit-Learn: For preprocessing utilities like encoding and scaling.
## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

###  Clone the repository:

              git clone https://github.com/varshitha-g/tmbd-movie-preprocessing.git
              cd tmbd-movie-preprocessing

## Usage

### Preprocess the Data: Run the preprocess.py script to execute the data preprocessing pipeline:

                python preprocess.py

                
Analyze Processed Data: After preprocessing, analyze the cleaned and engineered dataset for insights or use it as input for machine learning models.
